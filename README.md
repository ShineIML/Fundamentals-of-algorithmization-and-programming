# Fundamentals of algorithmization and programming
# Technical University of Kosice, Slovakia
# Ihor Rabin

My projects that I worked on at the university. Documentation for the tasks is attached.

All projects were written in pure C language using some university APIs.

Packages, that I was using to make projects work properly:

gcc make valgrind gdb cgdb cppcheck libncurses5-dev libncurses5 ncurses-doc git
